** a specific register:
**
** A free register (obviously) has a cost of 0 and a 1-bit in the free mask.
**
** An already allocated register has the (non-zero) IR reference in the lowest
** bits and the result of a blended cost-model in the higher bits.
**
** The allocator first checks the free mask for a hit. Otherwise an (unrolled)
** linear search for the minimum cost is used. The search doesn&apos;t need to
** keep track of the position of the minimum, which makes it very fast.
** The lowest bits of the minimum cost show the desired IR reference whose
** register is the one to evict.
**
** Without the cost-model this degenerates to the standard heuristics for
** (reverse) linear-scan register allocation. Since code generation is done
** in reverse, a live interval extends from the last use to the first def.
** For an SSA IR the IR reference is the first (and only) def and thus
** trivially marks the end of the interval. The LSRA heuristics says to pick
** the register whose live interval has the furthest extent, i.e. the lowest
** IR reference in our case.
**
** A cost-model should take into account other factors, like spill-cost and
** restore- or rematerialization-cost, which depend on the kind of instruction.
** E.g. constants have zero spill costs, variant instructions have higher
** costs than invariants and PHIs should preferably never be spilled.
**
** Here&apos;s a first cut at simple, but effective blended cost-model for R-LSRA:
** - Due to careful design of the IR, constants already have lower IR
**   references than invariants and invariants have lower IR references
**   than variants.
** - The cost in the upper 16 bits is the sum of the IR reference and a
**   weighted score. The score currently only takes into account whether
**   the IRT_ISPHI bit is set in the instruction type.
** - The PHI weight is the minimum distance (in IR instructions) a PHI
**   reference has to be further apart from a non-PHI reference to be spilled.
** - It should be a power of two (for speed) and must be between 2 and 32768.
**   Good values for the PHI weight seem to be between 40 and 150.
** - Further study is required.
