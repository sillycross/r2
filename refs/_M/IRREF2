** This allows for fast and uniform manipulation of all operands
** without looking up the operand mode in lj_ir_mode:
** - CSE calculates the maximum reference of two operands.
**   This must work with mixed reference/literal operands, too.
** - DCE marking only checks for operand &gt;= REF_BIAS.
** - LOOP needs to substitute reference operands.
**   Constant references and literals must not be modified.
